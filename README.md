An EDA is a thorough examination meant to uncover the underlying structure of a data set and is important for a company because it exposes trends, patterns, and relationships that are not readily apparent.
Myself and a group of data enthusiats, https://github.com/sesanmi, https://github.com/ChristianaBolanle, https://github.com/AbimSugar, performed exploratory data analysis on an Insurance Pricing Dataset.

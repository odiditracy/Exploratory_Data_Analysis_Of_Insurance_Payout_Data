# Exploratory_Data_Analysis_Of_Insurance_Payout_Data
An EDA is a thorough examination meant to uncover the underlying structure of a data set and is important for a company because it exposes trends, patterns, and relationships that are not readily apparent.
Myself and a group of data enthusiats performed exploratory data analysis on an Insurance Pricing Dataset. You will find attached our codes, summary slides and video presentation of our findings in this project. Do enjoy.
